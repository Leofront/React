# React

We created a fortune cookie with the aim of helping those who are starting out and want to learn about the programming language. 

In the App.js file, we create two classes, `App` and `Boton`, using `constructor`, `state`, `props` and functions. 

We also applied some CSS, even if in a basic way, to the `App` files, using the `ClassName`. I hope this is useful for you. 

If you have any questions, I am available to help.
